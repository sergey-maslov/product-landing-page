                    powerful magics in the defense of their shining kingdoms. Both knights and wizards fight side by
                    side on the field of battle against those who would threaten the sanctity and peace of the Alliance.
                    Although the Alliance has all but fallen apart, the valiant citizens of Azeroth and Lordaeron have
                    once again taken up arms against the enemies of humanity. </span>

                <span class="faction__description">The Orcs, who once cultivated a quiet Shamanistic society upon the
                    world of Draenor, were corrupted by the chaos magics of the Burning Legion and formed into a
                    voracious, unstoppable Horde. Lured to the world of Azeroth through a dimensional gateway, the Horde
                    was manipulated into waging war against the human nations of Azeroth and Lordaeron. Hoping that the
                    Horde would conquer the mortal armies of Azeroth, the Burning Legion made ready for its final
                    invasion of the unsuspecting world.</span>

                <h2 class="faction__title">Night Elves</h2>
                <span class="faction__description">The reclusive Night Elves were the first race to awaken in the World
                    of Warcraft. These shadowy, immortal beings were the first to study magic and let it loose
                    throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before Warcraft I. The Night Elves' reckless use of
                    magic drew the Burning Legion into the world and led to a catastrophic war between the two titanic
                    races. The Night Elves barely managed to banish the Legion from the world, but their wondrous
                    homeland was shattered and drowned by the sea. Ever since, the Night Elves refused to use magic for
                    fear that the dreaded Legion would return. The Night Elves closed themselves off from the rest of
                    the world and remained hidden atop their holy mountain of Hyjal for many thousands of years. As a
                    race, Night Elves are typically honorable and just, but they are very distrusting of the 'lesser
                    races' of the world. They are nocturnal by nature and their shadowy powers often elicit the same
                    distrust that they have for their mortal neighbors. </span>

                <h2 class="faction__title">Undead</h2>
                <span class="faction__description">The horrifying Undead army, called the Scourge, consists of thousands
                    of walking corpses, disembodied spirits, damned mortal men and insidious extra-dimensional entities.
                    The Scourge was created by the Burning Legion for the sole purpose of sowing terror across the world
                    in anticipation of the Legion's inevitable invasion. The Undead are ruled by Ner'zhul, the Lich
                    King, who lords over the icy realm of Northrend from his frozen throne. Ner'zhul commands the
                    terrible plague of undeath, which he sends ever southward into the human lands. As the plague
                    encroaches on the southlands, more and more humans fall prey to Ner'zhul's mental control and
                    life-draining sickness every day. In this way, Ner'zhul has swelled the ranks of the already
                    considerable Scourge. The Undead employ necromantic magics and the elemental powers of the cold
                    north against their enemies.</span>
